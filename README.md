[Final Project](https://github.com/antonioramos1/master-data-science-final-project)
 - Building an image retrieval engine that recommends customers new pieces of clothing.
 - Main technologies used: Python with Keras and Flask.
 
 ## Projects
 
 To improve my knowledge and experience in these technologies and topics I have also done the following projects:
 
- [Scraping tennis betting data](https://github.com/antonioramos1/master-data-science/tree/master/projects/webscraping-tennis):  
Using Python with Selenium and requests to do webscraping on a website with javascript dynamic content. Running the script remotely from a Droplet from DigitalOcean and saving all the contents to a SQL database.
- [WorldCup NLP Analysis](https://github.com/antonioramos1/master-data-science/tree/master/projects/nlp-worldcup):  
Using the Tweepy API to collect tweets from the Footbal WorldCup matches and applying text mining techniques. Finally using NLP libraries such as Textblob and SpaCy to do an entity analysis to find who are the most mediatic entities for different phases of the games.
- [Clothing classifier with Keras](https://github.com/antonioramos1/master-data-science/tree/master/projects/clothing-classifier-keras):  
Using Keras to train a CNN that classifies images from different categories of clothing.
